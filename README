The project directory contains two sub-directories:
1. Example Benchmarks- The directory benchmarks/ contains the tests.
   The benchmarks/tests/ directory contains the test and 
   benchmarks/src/Test.hs contain the calls to the benchmark tests.

2. Benchmark Results- The directory benchmark_results/ contain the
   timings for different benchmarks we executed.

Build and Execution
--------------------

The benchmarks can be built and installed using cabal. 

For executing the corresponding benchmark, use the following command
from .cabal/bin/ directory where the binary is installed:
./benchmarks <benchmark-name>

Example: ./benchmarks mydotp
